# ImageEncryptor-Huffman-LFSR

A C++ project that encrypts grayscale images using **Huffman Encoding** and **Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)** techniques. This project demonstrates basic concepts of lossless data compression and stream cipher encryption applied to images.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Read and process grayscale BMP images.
- âœ… Implement Huffman encoding for image compression.
- âœ… Use LFSR for stream cipher encryption and decryption.
- âœ… Save and visualize the encrypted and decrypted image data.
- âœ… Simple GUI using OpenCV to display original and processed images.

## ðŸ§  Concepts

### Huffman Encoding
Huffman coding is a lossless compression algorithm that assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring pixel values in an image. This project builds a Huffman tree and encodes image data accordingly.

### Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR)
LFSR is used to generate a pseudorandom binary sequence that serves as a stream cipher. This stream is XORed with the original (or compressed) image data for encryption.
